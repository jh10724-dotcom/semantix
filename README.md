> **Agents should not start from zero every session.**
>
> Semantix sits between an AI agent harness and its resources. It learns what you reuse, how you work, and what you are likely to need next — then turns that knowledge into semantic cache hits, smarter scheduling, safe prefetch, and lower-cost agent execution.

Semantix is designed to work with agent harnesses such as **DeepSeek-Reasonix**, Claude Code-style runtimes, and future custom agent systems.

The goal is not simply to reduce tokens.

The goal is to:

> **avoid unnecessary computation while preserving or improving agent quality.**

---

## Why Semantix?

Modern agent harnesses have become increasingly good at managing long-running sessions.

They can maintain context, call tools, compact history, recover from failures, and take advantage of provider-side prefix caching.

But most optimization still stops at the **session boundary**.

A new session often means:

* rebuilding project context
* repeating similar tool calls
* re-processing familiar instructions
* rediscovering the same files
* paying again for work the agent has effectively already done
* ignoring the user's historical workflow patterns

A traditional agent often behaves like this:

```text
Session A ────────────X
                      context ends

Session B ────────────X
                      context rebuilt

Session C ────────────X
                      similar work repeated
```

Semantix introduces a persistent optimization layer:

```text
Session A ───────┐
                 │
Session B ───────┼────► Semantix
                 │          │
Session C ───────┘          │
                            ▼
                    Semantic knowledge
                    Behavioral patterns
                    Reusable results
                    Cacheable context
                            │
                            ▼
                    Better next session
```

Instead of only asking:

> **How do we keep this session efficient?**

Semantix asks:

> **What has this user done before, what are they likely to do next, and what work can safely be reused?**

# Features

## Semantic Slice Library

At the center of Semantix is the **Semantic Slice Library (SSL)**.

Semantix extracts reusable semantic units from historical agent sessions and stores them in a persistent vector-indexed library.

Rather than treating an entire conversation as one large memory object, Semantix separates reusable information into different kinds of slices.

| Slice       | Meaning               | Used for              | Example                           |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **P-Slice** | Prompt / task pattern | L2 context injection  | `run tests before committing`     |
| **C-Slice** | Context knowledge     | L2 context injection  | project structure, build commands |
| **T-Slice** | Tool behavior pattern | scheduling / prefetch | `grep → readFile → editFile`      |
| **R-Slice** | Reusable result       | L3 result reuse       | repeated lookup or explanation    |
| **M-Slice** | Memory unit           | retrieval / evolution | user or project preferences       |

A slice is not automatically permanent.

Slices can be scored using signals such as:

* historical hit rate
* recency
* intent relevance
* successful injection
* user corrections
* explicit feedback
* reuse frequency

Low-value slices decay.

Useful slices become easier to retrieve.

The objective is for the library to become:

> **more precise — not simply larger.**

# Three-Layer Semantic Cache

Semantix adds semantic reuse on top of existing provider-side prefix caching.

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ L3 · Verified Result Reuse             │
│ Reuse work without a model call        │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L2 · Semantic Slice Injection          │
│ Meaning → stable canonical context     │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L1 · Provider Prefix / Byte Cache      │
│ Reuse identical prompt prefixes        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer has a different cost and risk profile.

---

## L1 — Provider Prefix Cache

Most provider-side prefix caches operate on identical or sufficiently stable prompt prefixes.

If the beginning of a request remains byte-stable, the provider may be able to reuse previously computed work.

This is fast and low risk.

But it has an important limitation:

```text
similar meaning ≠ identical bytes
```

Two prompts can mean almost the same thing while producing completely different cache keys.

Semantix keeps L1 as the foundation and tries to make the higher layers **feed it**.

---

## L2 — Semantic Slice Injection

This is one of the central ideas behind Semantix.

Suppose two different sessions have semantically similar tasks:

```text
Session A:
"Before finishing, run the Go test suite."

Session B:
"Make sure all Go tests pass before you're done."
```

The meaning is similar.

The bytes are not.

A normal prefix cache may treat them as unrelated.

Semantix instead retrieves a previously stored canonical slice:

```text
[workflow:test-before-finish]
Run `go test ./...` before marking the task complete.
```

That stable slice can then be inserted deterministically into the model context.

The flow becomes:

```text
semantic similarity
        │
        ▼
retrieve canonical slice
        │
        ▼
stable deterministic content
        │
        ▼
identical prompt bytes
        │
        ▼
provider prefix-cache hit
```

In other words:

> **Semantic caching does not replace the provider cache. It feeds it.**

To preserve cache stability, L2 injection should be deterministic:

* stable serialization
* stable ordering
* whole-slice injection
* deterministic retrieval
* injection-set freezing
* controlled updates

Changing the order or representation of otherwise identical slices can destroy the cache benefit.

---

## L3 — Verified Result Reuse

The highest cache layer can potentially skip a model request entirely.

For example:

```text
User asks:
"Where is the authentication middleware defined?"
```

If Semantix has already answered the same read-only question and the relevant files have not changed, it may be possible to reuse the existing result.

But:

> **semantic similarity is not semantic equivalence.**

For this reason, L3 is intentionally conservative.

Reuse can require checks such as:

* matching intent
* matching input fingerprint
* matching project
* unchanged dependent files
* file SHA / modification validation
* freshness window
* read-only task classification
* no unknown session state

L3 should be **fail-closed**.

If Semantix cannot prove that reuse is safe, it should send the task through the normal agent loop.

Write operations are never blindly replayed.

---

# Adaptive Kernel Scheduler

Semantix is not only a cache.

It also acts as a resource scheduler around the agent loop.

For every task, the kernel can consider:

```text
What is the user's intent?

Which context is useful?

Which model should handle the task?

Which tools are likely to be needed?

Which operations can run concurrently?

What can safely be reused?

What should be prefetched?

How much latency / token budget should be spent?
```

Inputs can include:

* task intent
* semantic slice matches
* historical tool patterns
* task complexity
* historical success rate
* model performance
* available resources
* latency budget
* token budget
* project state

The scheduler can then produce decisions such as:

```text
Model tier
    +
Context injection
    +
Tool concurrency
    +
Cache reuse
    +
Prefetch plan
```

The priority order is:

> **Correctness → Cache Reuse → Concurrency → Prefetch**

Optimization should never come before task correctness.

---

# Speculative Prefetch

Agent execution contains a surprising amount of waiting.

The system may be waiting for:

* LLM streaming
* network requests
* tool output
* file indexing
* embeddings
* external APIs

During that time, local resources are often idle.

Semantix attempts to use this waiting time to prepare likely next-step information.

---

## Learning Tool Patterns

T-Slices represent observed tool sequences.

For example, historical behavior might look like:

```text
grep
  │
  │ 87%
  ▼
readFile
  │
  │ 72%
  ▼
editFile
  │
  │ 81%
  ▼
test
```

The percentages represent learned transition tendencies, not hardcoded workflow rules.

Semantix can use several signals:

### Tool transition patterns

```text
P(tool B | tool A)
```

Example:

```text
grep → readFile
```

### File-path patterns

A project may repeatedly follow workflows such as:

```text
package.json
      ↓
src/
      ↓
tests/
```

### Semantic similarity

A current tool call may resemble a historical call whose next step is known.

---

## Conservative Prefetch

Prefetch is fundamentally speculative.

Therefore Semantix should primarily prefetch **read-only** resources.

Good candidates include:

* next-turn semantic slice assembly
* embedding queries
* index lookups
* safe metadata retrieval
* read-only context preparation

Operations with side effects must not be speculated.

Semantix should never decide:

```text
"You usually edit this file next,
so I edited it for you."
```

Instead:

```text
"You usually inspect this file next,
so I prepared the relevant context."
```

---

## Learning From Waste

Each speculative operation can be classified as:

```text
prefetch hit
```

or:

```text
prefetch waste
```

Repeatedly inaccurate predictions reduce that predictor's weight.

Therefore the prefetcher should learn two things:

> **when to predict**

and

> **when not to predict.**

---

# Self-Evolving Optimization

Semantix is designed around a feedback loop.

Every interaction generates signals.

Those signals influence future decisions.

```text
User behavior
      │
      ▼
Semantic slices
      │
      ▼
Retrieval + scheduling
      │
      ▼
Agent execution
      │
      ▼
Cost / latency / success / corrections
      │
      ▼
Feedback
      │
      ▼
Parameter updates
      │
      └──────────────────────► next interaction
```

Possible feedback signals include:

* L1 cache hit / miss
* L2 slice hit / miss
* L3 result reuse
* token cost
* latency
* task success
* user edits
* context pollution
* prefetch hit
* prefetch waste
* explicit approve / reject
* retries
* rollback events

---

## Online Adaptation

Lightweight statistics can adapt continuously.

For example:

* semantic similarity thresholds
* injection budgets
* prefetch thresholds
* model-tier selection
* concurrency limits

EWMA-style updates can allow the system to react to changing usage patterns without retraining a large model.

---

## Offline Optimization

More expensive optimization can happen periodically.

Examples:

* refresh embeddings
* retrain T-Slice transition matrices
* search better thresholds
* archive stale slices
* evaluate slice quality
* run ablation tests

The long-term goal is:

> **The system should improve because you use it.**

---

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The kernel observes the harness through an adapter/event layer.

It can then return optimization decisions without owning the agent's primary reasoning loop.

This allows Semantix to remain portable across different agent runtimes.

Semantix is not designed to replace Reasonix.

It is designed to make harnesses like Reasonix more efficient over time.

---

# Design Principles

## Correctness Comes First

Semantix follows one priority order:

> **Correctness → Cache Reuse → Concurrency → Prefetch**

A cheaper wrong answer is not an optimization.

---

## Stable Prefixes Matter

Provider prefix caches depend heavily on stable request prefixes.

Semantix therefore treats:

* canonical serialization
* stable ordering
* deterministic retrieval
* injection freezing

as first-class infrastructure.

A semantic cache should not constantly mutate the exact bytes it is trying to make cacheable.

---

## Semantic Similarity Is Not Equivalence

Two pieces of content can have high embedding similarity while still differing in important details.

Therefore:

```text
L1 → low risk

L2 → controlled contextual reuse

L3 → strict verification
```

The higher the potential optimization benefit, the stronger the validation should be.

---

## Read Before Write

Speculative operations must remain safe.

Read-only prediction can be useful.

Speculative mutation is dangerous.

Semantix may preload a likely file.

It should never silently modify that file because history suggests the user usually does so next.

---

## Fail Open

Semantix is an optimization layer.

It should never become a dependency that prevents the underlying agent from functioning.

If:

* embeddings fail
* the ANN index is unavailable
* semantic retrieval times out
* optimization confidence is low
* internal state becomes inconsistent

Semantix should simply fall back to the original harness.

```text
Semantix failure
       │
       ▼
Skip optimization
       │
       ▼
Normal agent execution
```

Optimization failure must not become agent failure.

---

## Every Optimization Must Be Reversible

Semantic injection, reuse, scheduling, and prefetch are probabilistic decisions.

Every major mechanism should therefore be:

* observable
* explainable
* measurable
* traceable
* independently disableable

A self-evolving system must also be able to recognize when it is evolving in the wrong direction.

---

## Privacy by Design

The Semantic Slice Library may contain:

* source code
* project context
* user workflow patterns
* historical instructions
* internal file paths

The intended architecture therefore favors:

* local storage
* local indexing
* configurable retention
* sanitization
* project/user isolation
* clear deletion controls

Cross-project reuse must avoid leaking project-specific secrets or paths.

---

# Project Status

> **Semantix is currently in the architecture and implementation-design phase.**

Architecture specification v2 is complete.

The project is planned to be implemented incrementally so each major optimization mechanism can be evaluated independently.

Current status:

# Roadmap

| Phase  | Deliverable                                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **P0** | Observability layer — harness adapter, event stream, baseline metrics           |
| **P1** | Semantic Slice Library — extraction, embeddings, ANN index, project/user stores |
| **P2** | Semantic cache — stable L2 injection, verified L3 reuse, pollution detection    |
| **P3** | Adaptive scheduler — intent classification, concurrency learning, model tier    |
| **P4** | Speculative prefetch — T-Slice prediction, path patterns, budget control        |
| **P5** | Evolution loop — online adaptation, offline optimization, ablation              |

Each stage should remain independently measurable.

The first major implementation hypothesis is:

> **Can deterministic semantic slice injection convert cross-session semantic similarity into provider-side prefix-cache hits without reducing task quality?**

# Target Metrics

The following numbers are **design targets**, not current benchmark results.

| Metric                               |                         Target |
| ------------------------------------ | -----------------------------: |
| Cross-session L2 cache hit rate      |                          ≥ 40% |
| Combined L1 + L2 cached input tokens |                          ≥ 90% |
| Cost per task                        |   ≥ 50% reduction vs. baseline |
| Prefetch utilization                 | ≥ 30% of eligible wait windows |
| Context pollution rate               |                           ≤ 5% |
| End-to-end latency                   |                     ≤ baseline |

These targets are intended to guide implementation and evaluation.

They should not be interpreted as achieved performance until reproducible benchmarks are published.

# Evaluation Philosophy

Semantix should not be evaluated only by token reduction.

A useful optimization layer has to measure at least four things simultaneously:

```text
Cost
  +
Latency
  +
Task Quality
  +
Reliability
```

An optimization that reduces token cost but causes:

* more retries
* worse answers
* stale context
* incorrect tool actions
* higher user correction rates

is not a successful optimization.

The target is:

> **lower effective computation per successful task.**

---

# What Semantix Is Not

Semantix is **not**:

* a foundation model
* another coding model
* a prompt compressor
* a vector database wrapper
* a replacement for an agent harness
* blind replay of previous tool actions
* a generic memory database

It is:

> **an optimization and learning kernel around agent execution.**

# Contributing

Semantix is still early.

Contributions, criticism, experiments, and architecture discussions are welcome.

Particularly useful areas include:

* semantic caching
* KV / prefix-cache optimization
* context engineering
* semantic retrieval
* agent scheduling
* speculative execution
* agent memory
* model routing
* behavioral learning
* local embeddings
* ANN indexing
* evaluation methodology
* Reasonix integration
* other harness adapters

If you disagree with an architectural assumption, open an issue.

Testing the assumptions is part of building the project.

# Acknowledgements

Semantix uses **DeepSeek-Reasonix** as its initial architecture baseline and first intended integration target.

Reasonix's work on:

* cache-stable agent execution
* context maintenance
* event-driven architecture
* tool orchestration
* session memory
* loop engineering

directly informed several Semantix design decisions.

Semantix extends those ideas toward persistent, cross-session optimization.
